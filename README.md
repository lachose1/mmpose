MMPose is an open-source toolbox for pose estimation based on PyTorch.
It is a part of the [OpenMMLab project](https://github.com/open-mmlab).

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.3+**.

### Major Features

- **Support top-down & bottom-up approaches**

  MMPose implements multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models for human pose estimation, including both top-down and bottom-up approaches.

- **Higher efficiency and Higher Accuracy**

  We achieve faster training speed and higher accuracy than other popular codebases, such as [HRNet](https://github.com/leoxiaobin/deep-high-resolution-net.pytorch).
  See [benchmark.md](docs/benchmark.md) for more information.

- **Well tested and documented**

  We provide detailed documentation and API reference, as well as unittests.

- **Modular design**

  We decompose MMPose into different components and one can easily construct a customized
  pose estimation framework by combining different modules.


## Benchmark and Model Zoo

We demonstrate the superiority of our MMPose framework in terms of speed and accuracy on the standard COCO keypoint detection benchmark.
